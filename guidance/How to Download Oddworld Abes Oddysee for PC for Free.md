Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is not only a game, but also a part of a larger project called Oddworld Quintology, which consists of five planned games that tell the story of Abe and his quest to save his world from destruction. The creator of Oddworld, Lorne Lanning, has described the Quintology as a "socially conscious epic" that aims to inspire and educate players about the issues facing our own planet.
 
The Quintology was originally intended to be released for PlayStation and PC, but due to various reasons, only two games were completed: Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. The latter was a direct sequel to the former, but was not considered part of the Quintology. The third game of the Quintology, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee, was released for Xbox and PC in 2001, but was significantly different from the original vision. The fourth and fifth games of the Quintology have not been released yet, but are still in development by Oddworld Inhabitants, the company behind Oddworld.
 
Oddworld Inhabitants has also released other games set in the same universe as Oddworld Quintology, such as Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath, Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, and Oddworld: Soulstorm. These games are not part of the Quintology, but are considered spin-offs or remakes that expand on the lore and characters of Oddworld. Oddworld Inhabitants has also collaborated with other developers and publishers to bring Oddworld games to various platforms and devices, such as PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, Steam, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.
